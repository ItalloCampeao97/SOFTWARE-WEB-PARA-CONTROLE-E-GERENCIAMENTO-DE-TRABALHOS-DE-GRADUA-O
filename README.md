# TG---FATEC-Ourinhos
This work aims to develop a web system that helps employees, teachers and students to control and manage TGs (Undergraduate work). Due to the great difficulty, for these users, who often do not have easy access to project information, it becomes necessary to use a reliable, accessible and dynamic system that makes it possible to monitor student performance and improve the progress of each job. In this way, a Java Web software was developed, which is able to offer facilities in the control and monitoring of each TG, allowing better communication among those involved.
